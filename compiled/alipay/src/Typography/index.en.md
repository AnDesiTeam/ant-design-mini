# Typography typesetting

## When to use

- It is used when a piece of text needs to be displayed. It supports ellipsis and is compatible with bold on different platforms.
- It can be used when action point operation buttons with icons are required.

## Precautions

- `icon` properties can support `Icon` Components `type` property, you can also pass in the link address of the icon directly.
- In disabled mode, you can pass in `onDisabledTap` Event, used to listen for the user's click on the text in the disabled state.
